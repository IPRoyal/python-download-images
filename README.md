How to Download Images from URLs with Python

While most developers use libraries like Requests, Urllib3, or Wget for fetching webpage HTML, these tools can also handle image downloads directly from URLs.
Instead of relying on third-party APIs, you can scrape and save images with just a few lines of Python code. This repository shows you how - including proxy support to avoid detection when scraping.

Downloading Single Image from URL

Python Requests

The Requests library is the easiest and most reliable way to download images in Python.
Use requests.get() to fetch the image
Save the content to a file in binary mode (wb)
Extract the file name from the URL to keep the correct extension
Add error handling (try/except) for network and file errors
Use proxies if you need to scrape at scale


Urllib3
Urllib3 is a lightweight HTTP client for Python, and it’s actually what Requests uses under the hood. You can use it directly to download images with just a few lines of code.

Always add a timeout to prevent hanging requests
Use ProxyManager() with make_headers() if your proxy requires authentication
Save the file using the original name from the URL to keep the correct extension
Wget
Wget is a simple Python wrapper for the classic Linux wget tool. It’s great for quickly downloading images or files with minimal code.
Use wget.download(url) with just the target URL.
By default, the file will be saved with the name taken from the URL.
Wget does not support proxies.
Downloading Multiple Images from a Website
Instead of direct image URLs, we can scrape a page’s HTML. Using BeautifulSoup, we extract <img> tags and their src attributes. Since some paths are relative, we apply urljoin to build full URLs. Once collected, we loop through the list of image URLs, download each, and save them as files. Below are examples with Requests, Urllib3, and Wget.
Python Requests
Urllib3
Wget
The Python Wget library only downloads files and can’t parse HTML for <img> tags. To download multiple images, we pair it with Requests to extract URLs. For simplicity, these snippets omit error handling and proxies, but in real projects you may also need rotating user agents, metadata handling, or custom file naming.

Python Libraries for Image Downloading Compared

Requests - The easiest and most versatile option. Great error handling, built-in proxy support, and widely used in web scraping. Best for most projects.
Urllib3 -  More control and performance than Requests, but slightly more complex. Suited for advanced users who need fine-tuned networking.
Wget - Extremely simple for one-off downloads, but limited since it can’t parse HTML or handle proxies natively.

Conclusion

Downloading images in Python is straightforward with Requests, Urllib3, or Wget. For most developers, Requests is the best all-around choice thanks to its simplicity and ecosystem. Use Urllib3 if you need performance and low-level control, or Wget if you just want quick, no-frills downloads.
